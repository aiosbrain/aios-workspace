# Getting started — zero to your first push

A linear, copy-pasteable path from a fresh clone to **your first `aios push` landing
on the team's Team Brain**, then on to contributing to the platform itself.

Written for a new team member. Our team slug is **`aios`**. Where a step needs a
person to act on the brain side, that person is **John** (the brain admin).

---

## 1. Where things live (read this first)

There are **two separate folders** in this story, and mixing them up is the #1 way
people get stuck. Neither is optional — you need both, but you only ever *work* in
the second one.

**Folder A — the toolkit you just cloned (`aios-workspace`).** This is a shared
program, not your personal space. You run one command from here, and never touch
most of it again day-to-day.

```
aios-workspace/                 ← you are here after `git clone` + `cd`
├── scripts/
│   ├── scaffold-project.sh     ← the ONE command that builds your real workspace (§5)
│   └── aios.mjs                ← the `aios` CLI (status/push/pull/query), run via `npm run aios`
├── scaffold/                   ← TEMPLATES ONLY — nothing here is a real file yet.
│   │                             See scaffold/README.md if you're curious; you
│   │                             shouldn't need to open this folder otherwise.
│   ├── aios.yaml.tmpl          ← turns into YOUR aios.yaml (folder B below), not this one
│   └── .claude/CLAUDE.md.tmpl  ← turns into YOUR .claude/CLAUDE.md (folder B below)
├── validation/                 ← checkers you point at YOUR workspace, from here
└── docs/                       ← this file, and the rest of the toolkit's own docs
```

**Folder B — your real workspace, created by step 5.** A brand-new folder,
usually `~/Projects/<your-slug>/`, with its **own separate git repo**. This is
where you work every day, and every file below is a real, filled-in file — none
of it is a template.

```
~/Projects/abe-workspace/       ← created FOR you by scaffold-project.sh — a new folder
├── aios.yaml                   ← HERE. At the top level. Real and filled in — not a template.
├── .env                        ← your API key goes here (you create it from .env.example)
├── 0-context/  1-inbox/  2-work/  3-log/  4-shared/  5-personal/   ← your spine (§2)
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md                ← real file, generated from the toolkit's CLAUDE.md.tmpl
│   └── rules/  skills/  rubrics/  memory/     ← the agent layer, copied in for you
└── README.md
```

**Straight answers to the exact questions that trip people up:**

- **"Is `aios.yaml` in the root, or in `/scaffold`?"** — The root of **folder B**
  (your workspace). It is never inside a `scaffold/` folder. Your workspace
  doesn't even *have* a `scaffold/` folder — that name only exists inside the
  toolkit (folder A).
- **"What's actually inside `/scaffold`?"** — Only templates: files ending in
  `.tmpl` with unfilled `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers, plus one filled worked
  example (`aios.yaml.example`). If you ever see a literal `{{...}}` in an
  error or in a file you're editing, a template got copied somewhere instead
  of generated — re-run `scaffold-project.sh` (see the Troubleshooting table).
- **"Is there a CLAUDE.md or README in `/scaffold` with instructions?"** — Not
  ones meant to be *read* directly. `scaffold/.claude/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` and
  `scaffold/README.md.tmpl` are templates that become your workspace's *real*
  `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` once you scaffold (folder B). `scaffold/README.md`
  (no `.tmpl`) is the one real file in that folder, and it just explains the
  folder itself to a human poking around — it is not workspace setup
  instructions.

If you remember one thing from this section: **you clone the toolkit once, run
one command, and then live in the folder that command creates.**

---

## 2. What you're setting up

AIOS is a three-part system: **your individual workspace** (folder B above — one
per person, you work here and choose what leaves your machine), the **Team Brain**
(the one shared hub that receives everyone's pushes and answers questions across
the team), and the **public site** (docs/marketing). You only run the workspace
locally; the brain is hosted. See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the
hub-and-spoke model.

Everything in the workspace carries an **access tier** that travels with the content:

| You write | Canonical | Syncs? |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `private` (consultant or employee) | `admin` | **never** — stays on your machine |
| `team` | `team` | yes — to the Team Brain |
| `client` (consultant) / `company` (employee) | `external` | yes — outward-facing |

**Hard rule:** `private`/`admin` content **never** leaves your machine, and **untagged
content never syncs** (default-deny). The CLI enforces this before any network call,
and the brain independently rejects `admin` content with a `422`. Promotion is always
a deliberate `aios push`.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Node ≥ 18** (`package.json` → `engines.node`). The `aios` CLI itself uses only
  Node built-ins (fetch, crypto, fs) — zero npm dependencies — so for sync you just
  need Node on `PATH`.
- **git**.
- `npm install` is only needed for the local GUI/cockpit and the test suite, not for
  scaffolding or `aios` sync.
- Once installed, `npm run help` lists every script grouped by category (Core / Dev /
  Build / Internal) — a bare `npm run` prints the same ~18 scripts with no grouping.

---

## 4. Get your Team Brain API key

A Team Brain **admin** issues you a per-member key. The key looks like
`aios_<key_id>_<secret>` and is **shown once** — copy it immediately. It is scoped to
**one team** (ours is `aios`).

**Ask John** to issue your key. For reference, the admin runs these *in the brain repo*
(`aios-team-brain`), not here:

```bash
# in aios-team-brain
npm run admin -- create-member abe@example.com --name "Abe" --handle abe --role member --team aios
npm run admin -- issue-key abe@example.com --team aios
```

The `issue-key` output is your `aios_…` key. Keep it out of git — it goes in `.env`
(gitignored), never in `aios.yaml`.

---

## 5. Scaffold your workspace

This is the one command from **folder A** (the toolkit) that builds **folder B**
(your real workspace) — see §1 if that distinction is still fuzzy.

You're an employee/contributor (not a client-facing consultant), so use
`--context employee`. From a clone of this toolkit:

```bash
scripts/scaffold-project.sh --context employee \
  --slug abe-workspace \
  --owner abe \
  --team "sam,jordan" \
  --brain-url https://brain.aios.example.com \
  --team-id aios \
  --output ~/Projects/abe-workspace
```

Flags (verified against `scripts/scaffold-project.sh`):

- `--context employee` — selects the employee spine skin (role/OKRs in `0-context`,
  company-shared `4-shared`, outward tier `company`). `consultant` is the other option.
- `--slug` — your workspace folder/identifier. **Required.**
- `--owner` — your member handle (becomes a workspace member so identity resolution
  passes — see Troubleshooting). **Required.**
- `--team "sam,jordan"` — *context only*; your teammates have their own workspaces.
  Optional.
- `--brain-url` / `--team-id` — pre-fill the brain connection in `aios.yaml`. Both
  optional; you can fill them in by hand later (step 6). Use `team_id: aios`.
- `--output` — where to create it (defaults to `~/Projects/<slug>`).

Add `--dry-run` to preview the spine without creating anything.

**What gets created** — the numbered spine (raw → refined), each folder's default tier:

| # | Folder | Holds | Default tier |
|---|--------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | `0-context/` | your role + OKRs (employee skin) | `team` |
| 1 | `1-inbox/` | raw inputs: transcripts, reference, from-brain | private |
| 2 | `2-work/` | your deliverables and working docs | `team` |
| 3 | `3-log/` | decision log, tasks (sync), hours (local) | private / `team` per file |
| 4 | `4-shared/` | company-shared, outward-facing | `external` (`company`) |
| 5 | `5-personal/` | private scratch — **never syncs** | private |

The scaffolder also drops in the `.claude/` agent layer (rules, skills, rubrics), the
governance hook, `aios.yaml` **(a real, filled-in file at the workspace root — not a
template, and not inside a `scaffold/` folder)**, `.env.example` **and a starter `.env`
copied from it** (so `npm run gui`/`aios onboard` never crash on a missing `.env` before
you've set anything), and an initial git commit. When it finishes it prints:

```
Workspace ready: ~/Projects/abe-workspace
Next:
  1. Connect the brain: set AIOS_API_KEY in .env, fill aios.yaml (brain_url, team_id)
  2. aios status   # what would sync (shell function installed; or: direnv allow .)
  3. Validate: …/validation/validate-all.sh ~/Projects/abe-workspace
```

The scaffolder also copies `bin/aios`, `.envrc` (`PATH_add bin`), and offers to run
`scripts/install-aios-shell.sh` (adds an `aios()` function to `~/.zshrc` that finds
`aios.yaml` walking up from cwd — no `npm run --` needed).

---

## 6. Connect to the brain

`cd ~/Projects/abe-workspace` — you are now inside **folder B**, your real
workspace, not the toolkit. Wire up two files, both at this folder's top level.

**`.env`** (gitignored — never commit it) — the scaffolder already created this for
you (copied from `.env.example`), so just fill in the real values:

```dotenv
# .env  — fake values shown; use the real key John issued you
AIOS_API_KEY=aios_demo_xxxxxxxx
AIOS_MEMBER=abe
```

**`aios.yaml`** — if you passed `--brain-url`/`--team-id` it's already filled. A
done-looking config (note `api_key_env` names the *env var*, never the secret):

```yaml
version: 1
brain_url: "https://brain.aios.example.com"
team_id: "aios"
api_key_env: AIOS_API_KEY

agent_runtime: claude-code
agent_personality: "aios"

sync_tiers:
  - team
  - company        # employee outward tier (→ external)

sync_include:
  - 0-context
  - 2-work
  - 3-log/decision-log.md
  - 3-log/tasks.md
  - 4-shared
  - .claude/memory
sync_exclude:
  - 5-personal

member: ""          # resolved from $AIOS_MEMBER / git config aios.member / git user.name
context: employee
```

> Leave `brain_url` empty to stay fully offline — every non-sync part of the workspace
> still works (see §8).

A filled reference also lives at
[`scaffold/aios.yaml.example`](../scaffold/aios.yaml.example) — **in the toolkit
(folder A)**, for you to eyeball or hand-copy values from. Don't copy
[`scaffold/aios.yaml.tmpl`](../scaffold/aios.yaml.tmpl) itself; it's unfilled
(see §1).

---

## 7. Your first push

Create something to push — say a deliverable in `2-work/`:

```bash
$ aios status

new (0):
modified (0):
blocked (1):
  2-work/sprint-plan.md — no `access:` frontmatter (default-deny)

clean (already synced): 0

blocked files never leave this machine. To sync one: add `access: team`
(or `external`) frontmatter — promotion is deliberate.
```

It's **blocked** because it has no tier. Add frontmatter to make it team-visible:

```yaml
---
status: draft
owner: abe
access: team
---
```

Re-run status — now it's eligible:

```bash
$ aios status

new (1):
  2-work/sprint-plan.md [deliverable, team]

modified (0):
blocked (0):
clean (already synced): 0
```

Push it:

```bash
$ aios push
pushed 1 item (new=1 modified=0) → https://brain.aios.example.com
```

Pull team updates (writes into `1-inbox/from-brain/`, append-only) and ask the brain
a question:

```bash
$ aios pull
pulled 3 items → 1-inbox/from-brain/

$ aios query "what's blocking sprint 2?"
…grounded answer with [S#] citations from tier-visible items…
```

That's your first push live on the Team Brain.

`aios review` does the same as `push` but interactively — toggle each file's inclusion,
then push the selection. Run `aios --help` for the full command list.

---

## 8. Working offline

No brain needed for: **scaffolding**, `validation/validate-all.sh`, the harness
skills, the whole **operator loop** (`aios loop daily|collect|weekly|verify|writeback`)
and **human-operating layer** (`aios asks`, `aios mode`, `aios decisions`, `aios spec`,
`aios rails`, `aios time`), `aios analyze` (agentic-maturity report from local logs),
`aios export-okf`, `aios graph`, `aios assess-codebase`, and `aios learn`. Only
**`push`**, **`pull`**, and **`query`** require a configured `brain_url` + key. Leave
`brain_url` empty to run fully standalone.

> Once you're set up, the [operating manual](GUIDE.md) is the task-oriented tour of all of
> the above — organized around your day, with real output and diagrams.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `401 unauthorized` | Bad, revoked, or expired key, or `X-AIOS-Team` ≠ your key's team. Re-check `AIOS_API_KEY` and `team_id: aios`; ask John to re-issue if needed. |
| `422 forbidden_tier` on push | You tried to push `private`/`admin`-tier (or untagged) content. **By design** — admin content never leaves the machine. Retag to `team`/`external` only if it really should be shared. |
| `member '<x>' is not in … members` | Your identity isn't on the workspace roster. The CLI resolves member from `$AIOS_MEMBER` → `aios.yaml` `member:` → `git config aios.member` → `git user.name`, then checks it against the workspace member list. Fix your identity or add yourself via `--owner`/the member list. |
| `cannot resolve member identity` | None of the sources above is set. Set one: `export AIOS_MEMBER=abe` or `git config aios.member abe`. |
| Key not yet issued | You haven't been provisioned. Ask John to run `create-member` then `issue-key` (§4). |
| `unknown sync tier '{{...}}'` (or any `{{...}}` in an error) | `aios.yaml` was copied straight from `scaffold/aios.yaml.tmpl` instead of being generated — its `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers were never substituted. This is the #1 mix-up in §1: `scaffold/` (folder A) is templates only, `aios.yaml` belongs in your workspace root (folder B). Re-run `scripts/scaffold-project.sh` (§5), or hand-fill a fresh `aios.yaml` from the worked example at `scaffold/aios.yaml.example`. |

## 10. Next: contribute to the platform

Once your first push is live, start contributing. The canonical end-to-end path (understand →
get access → scaffold → sync → first PR) is the website's
[Onboarding a contributor](https://aios-alpha.github.io/getting-started/onboarding-a-contributor/)
page. Each repo also has its own contributor guide:

- **`aios-workspace`** (this repo) — CLI, scaffold, validators, harness skills, GUI.
  See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **`aios-team-brain`** — Next.js dashboard, ingest pipeline, query layer.
  See its `DEVELOPMENT.md` (local setup + test tiers) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (PR gates).
- **`aios-alpha.github.io`** — the public docs (this getting-started path + the site).

The pinned sync contract is [`brain-api.md`](brain-api.md) — any change to the sync
protocol is a versioned change there *first*. For wiring integrations (Slack, Jira,
Notion, …) see [`integrations.md`](integrations.md).
